		"force_timescale"	"0" // Force the timescale every jump? Default is 0 for normal timescales.
		"velocity"			"1.0" // % of horizontal velocity to keep per jump. a value 0.9 will make the player lose 10% of their velocity per jump. Likewise, values above 1 will result in speed gains.

		"block_pright"		"0" // Block +right. 2 to stop timer.
