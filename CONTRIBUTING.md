# Contributing to bhoptimer

## Issues
Issue reports are one of the best things you can do to contribute to the development of bhoptimer.

When reporting an issue, please including the following information:
* The **game** your server is running. That's CS:S/CS:GO - I can't support other games or Source SDK mods!
* Are you using the **latest Steam version** of the game? I can't support old versions and I can't support non-Steam versions because they might be different!
* What's the operating system of your game server?
* Are you running the latest stable builds of SourceMod and Metamod: Source?
* What behavior were you expecting, and what's the actual behavior?

## Feature requests
You can start an issue as a feature request.
When doing so, please state that it's a feature request.
I cannot guarantee that I will add your feature due to complexity, not having enough free time or even if I see that it doesn't fit the project.
